\section{Jagged PCS-based VM security level calculation}

This section calculates the security level for a Jagged PCS-based VM in \cref{sec:jagged_security_level}.

\subsection{Jagged PCS parameters}

Global parameters used in the analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r_{FRI}$ --- number of FRI rounds.
    \item Folding factors $\folds=[k_0,k_1,\ldots,k_{r_{FRI}-1}]$;
    \item $t$ --- number of queries.
    \item $\delta$ --- proximity parameter.
    \item $\rho$ --- rate of the Reed-Solomon code.
    \item $\bgriq$ --- grinding parameter for the query phase.
    \item $N_{\text{trace}}$ --- maximum height of the trace.
    \item $B_{\text{trace}}$ --- number of columns of the trace.
    \item $N_{\text{stack}}$ --- height of the dense representation of the trace
    \item $B_{\text{stack}}$ --- the number of columns in the dense representation of the trace
    \item $d$ --- constraint degree
    \item $C$ --- number of constraints
    \item $\bhash$ --- number of bits in the hash function output.
    \item $\bproof$ --- proof size in bits.
    \item $\bfield$ --- number of bits in the extension field element.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security level for a Jagged PCS-based VM}\label{sec:jagged_security_level}
The security level is calculated only for the unique decoding regime. \\ 
The soundness error from FRI outside of the DEEP-ALI error can be analyzed exactly as batched FRI, with trace length $N_{\text{stack}}$ and batch size $B_{\text{stack}}$. 
The other soundness error comes from zerocheck, which checks 

$$\sum_{x \in H} \left( \text{eq}(r, x) \cdot \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda^i \cdot C_i(t_1(x), t_2(x), \cdots, t_B(x)) \right) = 0$$

where $H = \{0, 1\}^{\log N_{\text{trace}}}$ is the boolean hypercube. \\

The random linear combination from $\text{eq}(r, x)$ adds a $(\log N_{\text{trace}}) / q$ soundness error. The random linear combination from $\lambda^i$ adds a $C / q$ soundness error. Finally, the sumcheck routine adds a $((d + 1) \log N_{\text{trace}}) / q$ soundness error. \\

Combined, the overall soundness error from the zerocheck is at most 

$$\frac{C + (d + 2) \log N_{\text{trace}}}{q}$$

The random linear combination using multilinears for the $B_{\text{trace}}$ evaluations add an at most 

$$\frac{\log B_{\text{trace}}}{q}$$ 

soundness error, and the jagged evaluation and jagged sumcheck combined adds an at most 

$$\frac{6 \cdot (\log N_{\text{stack}} + \log B_{\text{stack}}) + 4}{q}$$

soundness error, as it is a degree 2 sumcheck with $2 \cdot \log \text{trace size} + 2$ variables and a degree 2 sumcheck with $\log \text{trace size}$ variables. These bounds are pessimistic, and the round-by-round soundness errors are lower.

\section{Jagged PCS proof size}

As in the security level calculation, the underlying dense PCS proof size can be analyzed with FRI's proof size with trace length $N_{\text{stack}}$ and batch size $B_{\text{stack}}$. Here, sizes of the other parts of the PCS proof are discussed.

\subsection{Sumcheck Proof Sizes}

Given a sumcheck of degree $d$ and number of variables $n$, the size of the sumcheck proof is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item univariate polynomials: $n$ degree $d$ polynomials, so $n(d+1)\bfield$.
    \item claimed sum: $\bfield$.
    \item evaluation point and result: $n\bfield + \bfield = (n+1)\bfield$.
\end{itemize}

So the overall size is 

$$\text{Sumcheck}(d, n) = (n(d+2)+2)\bfield$$

\subsection{Jagged PCS Proof}

The jagged sumcheck and jagged evaluation proofs lead to a sumcheck proofs of size 

$$\text{Sumcheck}(2, \log \text{trace}) + \text{Sumcheck}(2, 2 \cdot \log \text{trace} + 2)$$

where $\text{trace} = N_{\text{stack}} \cdot B_{\text{stack}}$ is the size of the trace.

\subsection{Zerocheck Proof}

The zerocheck proof with AIR degree $d$, is a sumcheck of degree $d+1$ with $\log N_{\text{trace}}$ variables, so it has size

$$\text{Sumcheck}(d + 1, \log N_{\text{trace}})$$
